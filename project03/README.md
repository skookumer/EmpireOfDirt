# Introduction
Description of the project

# Pseudocode
Put pseudocode in this box:

```python
GibbsMotifFinder(DNA, k-length)
    random pick of k-length sequences from each line of DNA as Motifs
    for j ← 1 to 10000 or Motifs stops changing
        i ← Random(N) where N is number of DNA entries
        PWM ← PWM constructed from all Motifs except for Motifi
        Motifi ← select position m from PWM-scored k-mers in DNAi in probabilistic fashion from score distribution
    return PFM
```
